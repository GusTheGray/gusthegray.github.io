# On the roles of product and QA in the secure SDLC
There's a lot of focus out there that I see on training developers to think about the security of their code, how to identify OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities, and be the champions of security on their teams. While I do agree that this is an important aspect of a good, secure, SDLC, I feel that other roles are being overlooked which could have an even larger impact.
